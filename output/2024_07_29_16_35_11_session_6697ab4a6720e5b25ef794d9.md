### **1. Google's AI-Driven Operations Lead to 48% Increase in Carbon Emissions**

Google's reliance on artificial intelligence has caused a significant surge in greenhouse gas emissions, with data centers supporting AI technology being a major contributor to the increase. Despite the company's goal of achieving net-zero emissions, Google's annual environmental report reveals that its greenhouse gas emissions have climbed nearly 50 percent over the past five years. This rise is largely due to the energy demands of AI, which consume significant amounts of electricity. Climate scientists urge responsible use of AI, noting that both large companies and individuals need to use energy only when it benefits society.
