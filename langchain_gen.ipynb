      "\n",
      "Ce modèle est conçu pour être accessible aux développeurs et aux utilisateurs, avec un coût de 15 cents par million de jetons d'entrée et 60 cents par million de jetons de sortie, ce qui le rend 60 % moins cher que le modèle précédent. Le GPT-4o mini surpasse également des modèles concurrents comme Gemini 1.5 Flash et Claude 3 Haiku sur divers benchmarks, y compris le raisonnement mathématique et la compréhension multimodale. \n",

      "- Il prend en charge des entrées et sorties textuelles et visuelles, avec des fonctionnalités futures prévues pour inclure des vidéos et de l'audio.\n",
      "- Le modèle a une fenêtre de contexte de 128 000 jetons, permettant des interactions plus longues, et est optimisé pour une utilisation moins énergivore.\n",

Le chatbot anti-woke de Musk, Grok, fait des déclarations controversées, accusant Trump de pédophilie et le qualifiant de 'Psycho'. Mark Cuban a récemment confronté Musk en utilisant son propre chatbot Grok, entraînant une résurgence d'une vieille dispute en ligne. Biden, agacé par Musk et ses alliés riches qui tentent d'influencer l'élection, a exprimé son mécontentement sur X, déclarant qu'il en avait 'assez' de Musk.

       " \"Une avancée potentiellement salvatrice dans la détection des vagues scélérates a été réalisée par des chercheurs de l'Université du Maryland. Ce nouvel outil basé sur l'intelligence artificielle (IA) peut prédire l'apparition de vagues scélérates jusqu'à cinq minutes à l'avance, offrant ainsi une chance de sauver des vies. Le taux de détection atteint 73 %, même lorsque le délai de préavis s'étend à cinq minutes, ce qui représente un progrès significatif dans la prévision fiable des vagues scélérates. Les vagues scélérates, qui sont des vagues géantes dépassant largement les crêtes des vagues normales, sont connues pour leur nature chaotique et terrifiante. Le modèle d'IA a été entraîné à partir de données provenant de bouées océaniques pour identifier ces vagues dangereuses, ce qui pourrait contribuer à la sécurité maritime.\",\n",
       " \"Un modèle d'IA capable de lire diverses images de cancer a été développé, réduisant la charge de travail des pathologistes et augmentant l'efficacité de l'examen des images médicales. En parallèle, un outil d'IA de l'Université de Cambridge s'est révélé trois fois plus précis pour prédire l'évolution des patients vers la maladie d'Alzheimer, réussissant à prédire avec succès quatre cas sur cinq si des personnes présentant des signes précoces de démence resteront stables ou développeront la maladie. L'IA joue également un rôle clé dans l'identification des cancers à risque élevé, une tâche que les oncologues ne peuvent pas réaliser avec les outils de diagnostic actuels. En outre, la détection du cancer du sein est révolutionnée par l'IA, offrant des avancées sans précédent en matière de précision et d'efficacité. Une enquête récente montre que les cancers sont perçus comme la principale préoccupation de santé, surpassant les inquiétudes liées à la démence ou aux maladies cardiaques, avec deux tiers du public exprimant des inquiétudes concernant un diagnostic de cancer.\",\n",

Goldman Sachs met en garde contre une bulle potentielle en IA, soulignant que les entreprises technologiques devraient investir plus de 1 trillion de dollars dans les infrastructures d'IA, notamment les centres de données, les puces et les réseaux électriques. Malgré les avertissements sur une bulle autour de la GenAI, une enquête récente montre que cette technologie est là pour rester, avec une préférence des entreprises pour des modèles d'IA privés et plus petits. Jim Covello, un analyste de Goldman Sachs, s'attend à une chute de la bulle IA, ayant appris par expérience les risques associés aux bulles technologiques. Par ailleurs, Microsoft a intégré la technologie d'OpenAI dans sa gamme de produits et a rapporté que les services d'IA avaient contribué à hauteur de 7 points de pourcentage à l'expansion de 31 % de ses ventes dans les services cloud au cours de son troisième trimestre fiscal.\",\n",

Trump a déclaré que Taiwan devrait payer pour la protection américaine, ce qui a suscité des inquiétudes parmi les investisseurs de grandes entreprises comme Nvidia, Microsoft et Tesla. Ces déclarations ont entraîné une chute des actions des fournisseurs de puces d\\'IA, car une éventuelle instabilité à Taiwan pourrait compromettre l\\'approvisionnement en puces d\\'IA, essentielles pour les centres de données des grandes entreprises. Par ailleurs, les fonds négociés en bourse (ETF) de semi-conducteurs ont également connu des fluctuations, témoignant des tensions géopolitiques exacerbées par les élections américaines de 2024. La relation entre Trump, la chute des actions de Nvidia et la situation à Taiwan illustre un mélange de géopolitique et d\\'une bulle technologique dans le secteur. De plus, Li, qui a pris une pause partielle de la codirection de l\\'Institut de Stanford pour l\\'IA centrée sur l\\'humain, tente de donner à l\\'IA une \"intelligence spatiale\" par une interprétation humaine des informations visuelles.
